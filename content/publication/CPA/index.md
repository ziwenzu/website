abstract: This paper tests whether environmental regulation could induce firms' directed innovation towards environmental related technologies, using a panel dataset of Chinese listed firms during the 2000-2016 period. We use the mandatory participation in the Cleaner Production Audit (CPA) program enforced by the central government of China as a quasi-natural experiment. Employing a difference-in-differences (DID) approach, we find that the CPA not only contributes to environmental innovation but also redirects technical changes from non-environmental areas toward environmental technological fields.
