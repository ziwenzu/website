Welcome to my personal website! Currently I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at the University of California, San Diego, and a research associate at the 21st Century China Center at UCSD.  My CV can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/v376a03psuigcsc/cv-zu.pdf?dl=0).  You can follow my google scholar [here](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=XpVWmF8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). On my website, you can find an overview of my research and teaching experiences, as well as my professional background.  Feel free to take a look around and don't hesitate to contact me with any questions.



I specialize in comparative politics with a regional focus on China and quantitative methods such as causal inference, text/video-as-data, and network analysis. My research interests include political economy, public opinion, and state-society relations. My current research agenda investigates two questions:

* How does the civil society affect authoritarian rule in China?
* How do coercive apparatruses (i.e. police, courts) exert social control and sustain legitimacy?
