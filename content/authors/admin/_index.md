I am a PhD Candidate in Environmental Economics and a [James B. Duke Fellow](https://gradschool.duke.edu/about/news/history-spotlight-james-b-duke-fellowship) at Duke University. I am also an [Energy Fellow](https://energy.duke.edu/about/energy-fellows) and an [Energy Data Analytics Fellow](https://energy.duke.edu/energy-data-analytics-phd-student-fellows) at the Duke University [Energy Initiative](https://energy.duke.edu/). 

I am interested in environmental and energy economics, climate policy, industrial organization, and applied econometrics. My research topics cover air pollution, climate change, innovation and development, and environmental regulation. My recent research focuses on:
* Information, risk perception, and household behavior
* Climate change impact and human capital adaptation
* Welfare impact of smart technology adoption in the electricity sector
* Energy efficiency, electrification, and policy design for net-zero emission target

Prior to Duke, I worked as a research associate at the [Environmental Research Center](https://dukekunshan.edu.cn/en/environment/about-research) of [Duke Kunshan University](https://dukekunshan.edu.cn/). I received my BA in Economics and BSc in Mathematics from [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/).
