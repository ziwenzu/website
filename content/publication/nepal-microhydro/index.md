abstract: Almost half of firms in South Asia identify electricity as a major constraint to operations.  We investigate whether electrification in Nepal -- via microhydro mini-grids -- helped grow the manufacturing sector. Electrification led to a substantial and statistically significant increase in formal manufacturing establishments; yet the overall presence remains limited due to low baseline numbers.  Labor shifts from self-employment and agriculture to employment for salary and wages. Increases in informal, non-agricultural household enterprises also contribute to labor changes. In more remote locations -- farther from the historical electrical grid -- the impacts of microhydro on manufacturing establishments are significantly muted.
