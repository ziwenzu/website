Welcome to my personal website! I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at the University of California, San Diego with a specialization in computational social science. I am also a research associate at the 21st Century China Center at UCSD.  My research focuses on state-society relations in authoritarian regimes, with a regional focus on China. Methodologically, I am interested in causal inference and text-as-data methods.
