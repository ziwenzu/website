As an instructor, my aim is to develop students' passion in economics, equip them with tools they can use to understand the world around them, and more importantly, engage them in evidence-based policy-making processes. There are three principles I embrace in teaching and incorporate into all of my interactions with students: (1) student-centered personalized learning; (2) active and inclusive learning; (3) application and real-world connections.
